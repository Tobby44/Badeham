                <h2>As we sell used cars, you should expect some wear & tear</h2>
                <p>Every Cazoo car has been reconditioned to our standards at our Vehicle Preparation Centres. Since we sell used cars, there may be signs of general wear and tear, which is completely normal.</p>

                <h2>All cars have a mechanical & safety check</h2>
                <p>We own all our cars and purchase less than 5% of the cars that we look at.</p>
                <p> Our technicians inspect the mechanical aspects of the car, from the oil levels to the condition of the brake pads. We also make sure that safety-related items, such as seat belts and airbags, are in full working order.</p>
